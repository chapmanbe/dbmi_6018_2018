    "## Use Case: Refactoring pyConTextNLP\n",
    "\n",
    "[pyConTextNLP](https://github.com/chapmanbe/pyConTextNLP) is a natural language processing software package I developed as part of an image processing grant. It is a generalization and partial implementation of the ConText algorithm developed by Wendy Chapman, et al. The code is now widely used, particularly in Utah, but also by researchers throughout the States as well as Sweden, England, Finland, Italy, and other countries. The code is in desperate need of refactoring for both improved functioning and improved user interactions. In particular, I am interested in creating a functional version of the Code\n",
